      <description>#This meetup will be held on October 30, 2018.
=== Talk 1 ===
Alteryx â€“ TBD
Title: Using R to build large-scale models with Alteryx
Abstract:
Alteryx will demonstrate how you can leverage your R skills in Alteryx to build large-scale models and deploy them. Alteryx makes deploying a predictive model easy with the click of a button. Alteryx exposes an R and Python interface via standard REST API requests, instead of recoding the models from within their native languages, integration of your most advanced analytic models into production systems is simple and painless.</description>

      <description>These talks were given on September 25, 2018.

== Talk 1 ==
APIs, JSON and R (Peter S.)
Access RESTful APIs using httr, jsonlite and tidyverse packages. Focus will be writing R code.
== Talk 2 ==
Similarity measure in the space of color palettes (Emil H.)
Related to my project of creating a catalog of all available color palettes in r https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/ r-color-palettes and its associated r package https://CRAN.</description>

      <description>These talks were given on August 28, 2018.

Talk 1: Classification and Statistical Analysis of Cancer Mutations Scores By: Yemi Odeyemi (Ph.D. Candidate in Data Science at Chapman University)
The talk will describe part of Yemi&amp;rsquo;s doctoral work on building a statistical and predictive model to classify driver-passenger mutations. A Logit model is used with 10-fold cross-validation. The data was preprocessed to impute missing values using the rule-of-thumb approach, removal of redundant features and feature scaling.</description>

      <description>These talks were given on July 31, 2018.

This month we great talks from UCI&amp;rsquo;s first set of graduates in the Master of Science, Business Analytics program. The talks are based on the analysis done by a team of graduate students during their five-month Capstone projects. As an interesting twice, one team did the analysis using python and the other used R. Both are great languages for analytical work.</description>
