      <description>These talks will be given on January 29, 2019.

==== Talks Speaker: Ryan Benz
Title: Tibbles, and list columns, and nested data frames, oh my!
Tibbles are a &amp;ldquo;modern reimagining of the data.frame&amp;rdquo; and are a big part of the tidyverse, but what are they really, how are they different from standard data frames, any why should you care about using them? In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll dive into tibbles and show how they can be used in several interesting ways taking advantage of list columns and nested data frames.</description>

=== Talk 1 ===
Alteryx – TBD
Title: Using R to build large-scale models with Alteryx
Abstract:
Alteryx will demonstrate how you can leverage your R skills in Alteryx to build large-scale models and deploy them. Alteryx makes deploying a predictive model easy with the click of a button. Alteryx exposes an R and Python interface via standard REST API requests, instead of recoding the models from within their native languages, integration of your most advanced analytic models into production systems is simple and painless.</description>

      <description>These talks were given on August 28, 2018.

Talk 1: Classification and Statistical Analysis of Cancer Mutations Scores By: Yemi Odeyemi (Ph.D. Candidate in Data Science at Chapman University)
The talk will describe part of Yemi&amp;rsquo;s doctoral work on building a statistical and predictive model to classify driver-passenger mutations. A Logit model is used with 10-fold cross-validation. The data was preprocessed to impute missing values using the rule-of-thumb approach, removal of redundant features and feature scaling.</description>

This month we great talks from UCI&amp;rsquo;s first set of graduates in the Master of Science, Business Analytics program. The talks are based on the analysis done by a team of graduate students during their five-month Capstone projects. As an interesting twice, one team did the analysis using python and the other used R. Both are great languages for analytical work.</description>
