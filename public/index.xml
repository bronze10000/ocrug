      <description>Talk 1: Classification and Statistical Analysis of Cancer Mutations Scores By: Yemi Odeyemi (Ph.D. Candidate in Data Science at Chapman University)
The talk will describe part of Yemi&amp;rsquo;s doctoral work on building a statistical and predictive model to classify driver-passenger mutations. A Logit model is used with 10-fold cross-validation. The data was preprocessed to impute missing values using the rule-of-thumb approach, removal of redundant features and feature scaling. Feature selection was determined using a stepwise approach based on AIC.</description>

      <description>Details This month we great talks from UCI&amp;rsquo;s first set of graduates in the Master of Science, Business Analytics program. The talks are based on the analysis done by a team of graduate students during their five-month Capstone projects. As an interesting twice, one team did the analysis using python and the other used R. Both are great languages for analytical work.
