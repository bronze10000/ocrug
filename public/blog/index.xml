      <description>Details This month we great talks from UCI&amp;rsquo;s first set of graduates in the Master of Science, Business Analytics program. The talks are based on the analysis done by a team of graduate students during their five-month Capstone projects. As an interesting twice, one team did the analysis using python and the other used R. Both are great languages for analytical work.
